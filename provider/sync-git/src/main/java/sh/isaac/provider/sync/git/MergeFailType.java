 * {@link MergeFailType}
 *
 * During update and commit operations, if there is uncommitted work, we have to stash, if we are using git.
 * During the apply of stash, we may have a merge failure, if the incoming changes also changed the same files
 * that are changed in the stash.  Unfortunately, The notion of "OURS" and "THEIRS" which correspond to
 * {@link MergeFailOption#KEEP_LOCAL} and {@link MergeFailOption#KEEP_REMOTE} reverse, depending on whether we are
 * fixing a conflict that resulted from the merge failure, or a conflict that resulted from the stash apply failure.
 * So, the caller will have to inform us which type of merge failure they are fixing.
