/**
 * This class executes the jobs to write to disk, and also has a single thread running to call .get() on
 * the future for each job submitted, to ensure that any errors are logged / warned (if the caller didn't bother
 * to call get)
 *
 * Previous versions of this class used the ExecuterCompletionService stuff... but that turns out to be fundamentally
 * broken in combination with JavaFX Task objects - you end up with a Task and a Future, and the Task never gets completion
 * notification.
