/**
 * A transient component derived from a logical expression. Attempts to persist

 * The native identifier and UUID for this component is synthetic, and guaranteed unique,
 * within the life span of the ConceptChronology object from which it is derived.
 * The native identifier will not participate in UUID to nid maps or other aspects
 * of the identifier service. This object is not allowed to have associated sememes
 * because it is transient.
 * <br/>
 * The RelationshipVersionAdaptor objects cannot be retrieved from the
 * {@code IdentifiedObjectService} at this time, since they are transient. They can
 * only be retrieved by calling getRelationshipListWithConceptAsDestination or
 * getRelationshipListOriginatingFromConcept on the ConceptChronology objects.
 * <br/>
 * Components that use relationships should transition to using logic graphs directly.
