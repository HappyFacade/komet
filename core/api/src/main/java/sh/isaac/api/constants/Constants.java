/**
 * Created by kec on 9/11/14.
 *
 * A typical datastore structure would look like this:
 *
 * somePath/data/object-chronicles/cradle/{content}
 * somePath/data/search/lucene/{content}
 *
 * {@link #DATA_STORE_ROOT_LOCATION_PROPERTY} can be utilized to set the absolute path to the location of the 'data' portion of the paths in the
 * example above. {@link #DEFAULT_CHRONICLE_FOLDER} will be automatically appended to the path to create the chronicle path. {@link
 * #DEFAULT_SEARCH_FOLDER} will be automatically appended to the path to create the search path.
 *
 * If you have a data structure where the object-chronicles folder does not share a common parent folder with the search folder, then you may utilize
 * the {@link #CHRONICLE_COLLECTIONS_ROOT_LOCATION_PROPERTY} and {@link #SEARCH_ROOT_LOCATION_PROPERTY} to specify the absolute path to the
 * 'object-chronicles' and 'search' components of the above examples, respectively.
