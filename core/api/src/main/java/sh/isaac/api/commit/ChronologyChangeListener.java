/**
 * Observable update rules:
 * 1. A Chronology update will be sent to the ObservableChronology with the
 same nid, to update the contents of the ObservableChronology, if it is
 in memory.

 2. A SemanticChronology update will be sent to the ObservableConceptChronology
 of it's assemblage if it is in memory. If it is in memory, and the ObservableList
 of the assemblage's semanticChronology is is memory, then the observable Semantic list will
 be properly updated.

 3. A SemanticChronology update will be sent to the ObservableChronology of the referenced
 component if it is in memory, and will update the Semantic for component ObservableList
 if it is instantiated.

 4. A SemanticChronology update will be sent to the taxonomy manager. The taxonomy
 manager will check for updated to the stated and inferred taxonomy.

 5. A SemanticChronology update will be sent to the LogicService. The logic service
 will determine if changes impact incremental or fully classified data, and will update
 the logic status accordingly.
