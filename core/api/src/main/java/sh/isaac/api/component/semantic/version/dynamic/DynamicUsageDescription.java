/**
 * {@link DynamicUsageDescription}
 *
 * In the new DynanamicSememeAPI - there are strict requirements on the structure of the
 * assemblage concept.
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * The assemblage concept must define the combination of data columns being used within this Sememe.
 * To do this, the assemblage concept must itself contain 0 or more {@link DynamicSememeVersion} annotation(s) with
 * an assemblage concept that is {@link DynamicConstants#DYNAMIC_SEMEME_EXTENSION_DEFINITION} and the attached data is<br>
 * [{@link DynamicSememeInteger}, {@link DynamicSememeUUID}, {@link DynamicSememeString}, {@link DynamicSememePolymorphic},
 * {@link DynamicSememBoolean}, {@link DynamicSememeArray< DynamicSememeString >}, {@link DynamicSememeData< DynamicSememePolymorphic >}]
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>The int value is used to align the column order with the data array here.  The column number should be 0 indexed.
 * <li>The UUID is a concept reference where the concept should have a preferred semantic name / FQN that is
 *       suitable for the name of the DynamicSememe data column, and a description suitable for use as the description of the
 *       Dynamic data column.  Note, while any concept can be used here, and there are no specific requirements for this
 *       concept - there is a convenience method for creating one of these concepts in
 *       {@link DynamicColumnInfo#createNewDynamicSememeColumnInfoConcept(String, String, org.ihtsdo.otf.tcc.api.coordinate.EditCoordinate, org.ihtsdo.otf.tcc.api.coordinate.ViewCoordinate)}
 * <li>A string column which can be parsed as a member of the {@link DynamicSememeDataType} class, which represents
 *       the type of the column.
 * <li>An (optional) polymorphic column (any supported data type, but MUST match the data type specified in column 2) which contains
 *       the default value (if any) for this column.
 * <li>An (optional) boolean column which specifies if this column is required (true) or optional (false or null) for this column.
 * <li>An (optional) array column which contains strings which can be parsed as a member of the {@link DynamicSememeValidatorType} class, which represents
 *       the validator type(s) assigned to the the column (if any).
 * <li>An (optional) array column which contains polymorphic data (any supported data type, but MUST match the requirements of the validator specified in column 6)
 *       which contains validator data (if any) for this column.
 *
 *       The validator data array must match in size to the validator type data.  They will be evaluated as pairs.
 * </ul>
 * <br>
 * Note that while 0 rows of attached data is allowed, this would not allow the attachment of any data on the sememe.
 * <br>
 * The assemblage concept must also contain a description of type {@link IsaacMetadataAuxiliaryBinding#DEFINITION_DESCRIPTION_TYPE} which
 * itself has a semantic extension of type {@link DynamicConstants#DYNAMIC_SEMEME_DEFINITION_DESCRIPTION} - the value of
 * this description should explain the the overall purpose of this Sememe.
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * The assemblage concept may also contain a single {@link DynamicSememeVersion} annotation of type
 * {@link DynamicConstants#DYNAMIC_REFERENCED_COMPONENT_RESTRICTION} with a one or two string column(s) which can be parsed as
 * a {@link ObjectChronologyType} and a {@link VersionType}- which will restrict the type of nid that can be placed
 * into the referenced component field when creating an instance of the assemblage.
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * The class {@link DynamicUsageDescription} provides an implementation for parsing the interesting bits out of an assemblage concept.
 *
 * For an implementation on creating them,
 * See {@link sh.isaac.impl.sememe.DynamicSememeUtility#createNewDynamicSememeUsageDescriptionConcept}
